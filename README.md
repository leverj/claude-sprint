# claude-sprint

A scrum-aligned development workflow on top of **GitHub Projects v2**, runnable across multiple AI coding tools. Requirements live as structured GitHub Issues; sprint state (Status, Priority, Size, Iteration) lives on a Project board configured per GitHub's "Team Planning" template. Architectural decisions are recorded as ADRs in the repo. Any developer can pick up where someone left off.

## Prerequisites

- A supported AI coding tool (see below)
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`)
- A git repo with a GitHub remote

## Supported tools

The canonical workflow lives in `SKILL.md`. `AGENTS.md` is a git symlink to it (mode `120000`), and `GEMINI.md` imports it via `@./SKILL.md` — so every tool reads the same source with no manual sync.

| Tool | Discovery file | Install doc |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/sprint/SKILL.md` | [docs/install/claude-code.md](docs/install/claude-code.md) |
| Codex CLI | `AGENTS.md` (project root) | [docs/install/codex.md](docs/install/codex.md) |
| Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md` (project root) | [docs/install/gemini-cli.md](docs/install/gemini-cli.md) |
| Cursor | `AGENTS.md` or `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` | [docs/install/cursor.md](docs/install/cursor.md) |
| OpenCode | `AGENTS.md` (project root) | [docs/install/opencode.md](docs/install/opencode.md) |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | `AGENTS.md` (project root) | [docs/install/copilot-cli.md](docs/install/copilot-cli.md) |

## Quick install

Claude Code (native skill):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leverj/claude-sprint ~/.claude/skills/sprint
```

Other tools (clone once, link from each project):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leverj/claude-sprint ~/sprint-workflow
cd /path/to/your/project
ln -s ~/sprint-workflow/AGENTS.md AGENTS.md   # or GEMINI.md, .cursor/rules/sprint.mdc, etc.
```

On Windows, enable git symlinks (`git config --global core.symlinks true`, run as admin) or `cp` the file and re-copy on update.

## Updating

From inside any project that uses the skill:

```
/sprint upgrade                          # pull latest on current branch
/sprint upgrade feat/some-branch         # switch to a branch (e.g., to test a PR)
/sprint upgrade reset                    # return to default branch (master/main)
/sprint upgrade check                    # dry-run; show what would change
```

Or do it manually:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/sprint && git pull   # or ~/sprint-workflow
```

## Quick Start

```
/sprint setup          # Discover/create the Project, configure fields, link this repo
/sprint plan           # Create structured requirements as GitHub Issues + Project items
/sprint pick           # Claim an item from the board and implement it
/sprint status         # Dashboard of the current iteration
```

After `/sprint setup`, open the Project's **Workflows** settings page (link is printed at the end of setup) and enable: *Auto-add to project*, *Item closed → Done*, *Pull request opened → In Review*, *Pull request merged → Done*. These are UI-only toggles GitHub does not expose via API.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/sprint plan` | Discuss and create one or more structured GitHub Issues with acceptance criteria, phases, and risks. Adds them to the Project with Status / Priority / Size set, optionally to an iteration. |
| `/sprint pick [N]` | List available items from the board, claim one, create a branch, implement phase by phase, create a PR. Status: Ready → In Progress → In Review. |
| `/sprint decide ["title"]` | Record an architectural decision in `.dev/decisions/`, cross-link to GitHub Issues. |
| `/sprint status [all]` | Dashboard read from the Project board. Shows current iteration prominently. `status all` includes other iterations and unscheduled items. |
| `/sprint refine [N]` | Take a Backlog item and add structured acceptance criteria, phases, risks, Priority, and Size — moves it to Status: Ready. |
| `/sprint setup` | Discover or create a GitHub Project, configure Team Planning fields, link this repo, persist `.dev/sprint-config.json`. |
| `/sprint upgrade [branch\|reset\|check]` | Pull the latest skill from origin. Optional branch arg switches branches (sticky until reset). |

## How It Works

### Requirements as GitHub Issues

`/sprint plan` creates Issues with a structured format:

- **User Story** — "As a [role], I want [capability] so that [benefit]"
- **Acceptance Criteria** — WHEN/THEN/SHALL format, directly testable
- **Implementation Phases** — ordered checkboxes, each independently verifiable
- **Risk Assessment** — technical risks, dependencies, unknowns

### Sprint state lives on the Project board

State that scrum tools track — Status (Backlog / Ready / In Progress / In Review / Done), Priority (P0 / P1 / P2), Size (XS / S / M / L / XL), Iteration — are **GitHub Project fields**, not labels. The skill reads and writes those fields directly via `gh project`.

The first `/sprint setup` either links this repo to an existing Project or creates a new one named after the repo. Choice is persisted in `.dev/sprint-config.json` (`project_number` only — names are renameable in the GitHub UI without breaking anything).

The Iteration field is created **lazily** the first time someone names a sprint; until then, items live in an "infinite sprint" (no iteration assigned).

### Concurrency via GitHub Assignment

When a developer runs `/sprint pick`, the skill assigns the issue to them on GitHub before starting work and moves the Project Status to `In Progress`. Other developers see the item as taken. GitHub assignment is the lock — no file-based coordination needed.

### Decisions as ADRs

`/sprint decide` creates files in `.dev/decisions/` with context, rationale, alternatives considered, and consequences. These are version-controlled alongside the code they govern. GitHub Issues get a comment linking to the decision for cross-reference.

### Phase-by-Phase Implementation

`/sprint pick` doesn't implement everything at once. It works through the Implementation Phases defined on the issue:

1. Implement the phase (with a [Dependency Safety Check](SKILL.md#dependency-safety-check) gate before any new dependency is added)
2. Write/update tests
3. Update the phase checkbox on GitHub
4. Move to next phase

After all phases are complete, the skill presents the changes for review. **Code is never committed, pushed, or turned into a PR without explicit developer approval.** The developer reviews the diff, adjusts the commit message if needed, and confirms before anything leaves the local machine.

If a session ends mid-work, the next developer can see which phases are checked off.

## Labels (small set)

Labels are intentionally minimal — Status / Priority / Size live as Project fields, not labels.

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `type:feature` | New functionality (drives `feat/` branch prefix) |
| `type:bug` | Something broken (drives `bug/` branch prefix) |
| `type:refactor` | Internal improvement (drives `refactor/` branch prefix) |

`package:*` labels are created on-the-fly for monorepo projects (e.g., `package:ui`, `package:server`).

## Decision Records

Decisions are stored in `.dev/decisions/` with this naming convention:

```
.dev/decisions/D-001-use-supabase-for-auth.md
.dev/decisions/D-002-monorepo-structure.md
```

Each file captures: Context, Decision, Rationale, Alternatives Considered, and Consequences.
